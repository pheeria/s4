# S4 - Super Simple Search Service

## What is this?

This is a humble attempt to implement the following concepts of a search engine:
- inverted index
- relevance score (TF-IDF)
- synonyms
- highlighter

## What is that other markdown file?

Glad you asked. There is an accompanying presentation which you can follow using [lookatme](lookatme).

## Is this engine ready?

Nope and you shouldn't try to repeat this at home.
